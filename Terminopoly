the players have to be initialized or added to the game.
-> user will require a request: how many players will be playing?

once the players are added, each player will start off with WTC500.
-> create objects in python - this object will require a name and an amount

player one will roll two die. that number will be the number of spaces moved.
-> player 1 needs to be promted to roll the dice. Once the dice is rolled, this
number needs to be saved and a list needs to be traversed.


if the player rolls a number, move that number of spaces on the blocks.
-> the list needs to be checked. once this is landed on, the user needs to
be promted for further action.
 --> purchase property for WTC_XXX
     player1.money - WTCXXX
     update players amount of money

 --> auction property
     'all players bid for this property'

 --> check if another player is already on that block:
     'if another player is on the block, the landed player should only have the option
     to rent the property'

 --> once all conditions have been checked, the next player rolls the dice

once the player lands on a block, the block that they landed on needs to be checked.


this will contain a name, an owner, a price and a rental amount.
-> need to create a class for each card that has the same properties
-> these cards will then be added to a list

if the player lands on a chance or community chest, the first item in the list should be passed.
-> community chest should be a class
-> free parking to be a null card
-> go straight to jail to be a card that sends the user to jail | the  user then
   needs to roll the dice 3 times in order to move on. A minimum threshold should be set
   if this threshold is achieved, the user can move one block and the next player proceeds.
